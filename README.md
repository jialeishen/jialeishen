I'm a PhD student in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at Syracuse University. I'm interested in the research on building energy and environment, indoor air quality, green building, and urban microclimate. Please visit my personal page [jialeishen.com](http://www.jialeishen.com) to know more about me.
